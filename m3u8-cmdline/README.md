# M3U8 to Angelthump

Quick script for streaming m3u8 to angelthump.

## Getting Started

Requires Python 3 and FFmpeg. Once script is downloaded you will need to have a copy of your angelthump stream key and use `--streamkey STREAMKEY`
to set it.

Streamkey does not need to be set everytime you use this script.

Only tested on Windows and Ubuntu. May not work on other operating systems.
